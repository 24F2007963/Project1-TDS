You have just enrolled in the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/2025-01/) course.\n\nOut of kindness for your teaching assistants, you have decided to build an API that can automatically answer student questions on their behalf based on:\n\n- [Course content](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/2025-01/) with content for TDS Jan 2025 as on 15 Apr 2025.\n- [TDS Discourse posts](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/c/courses/tds-kb/34) with content from 1 Jan 2025 - 14 Apr 2025.\n\n## Scrape the data\n\nTo make sure you can answer these questions, you will need to extract the data from the above source.\n\n## Create an API\n\nYour application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Let's assume it's at `https://app.example.com/api/`.\n\nThe endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. `POST https://app.example.com/api/` with a student question as well as optional base64 file attachments as JSON.\n\nFor example, here's how anyone can make a request:\n\n```bash\ncurl \"https://app.example.com/api/\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d \"{\\\"question\\\": \\\"Should I use gpt-4o-mini which AI proxy supports, or gpt3.5 turbo?\\\", \\\"image\\\": \\\"$(base64 -w0 project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp)\\\"}\"\n```\n\nThis is a [real question](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939) and uses this [screenshot](images/project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp):\n\n![Screenshot](images/project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp)\n\nThe response must be a JSON object like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"You must use `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`, even if the AI Proxy only supports `gpt-4o-mini`. Use the OpenAI API directly for this question.\",\n  \"links\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/4\",\n      \"text\": \"Use the model that\u2019s mentioned in the question.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/3\",\n      \"text\": \"My understanding is that you just have to use a tokenizer, similar to what Prof. Anand used, to get the number of tokens and multiply that by the given rate.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe response must be sent within 30 seconds.\n\n## Evaluate your application\n\nHere are a few [sample questions and evaluation parameters](project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml \":ignore\"). These are **indicative**. The actual evaluation could ask _any_ realistic student question.\n\nTo run this:\n\n1. Edit [`project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml`](project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml \":ignore\") to replace `providers[0].config.url` with your API URL.\n2. Run this script:\n\n   ```bash\n   npx -y promptfoo eval --config project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml\n   ```\n\n## Deploy your application\n\nDeploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform.\n\n(If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your results.)\n\n## Share your code\n\n- [Create a new _public_ GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)\n- [Add an MIT `LICENSE` file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository)\n- Commit and push your code\n\n## Submit your URL\n\nSubmit your GitHub repository URL and your API endpoint URL at https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-project-virtual-ta\n\n## Evaluation\n\n- **Pre-requisites**: Your repository **MUST** meet the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation\n  - Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible\n  - Your GitHub repository has a `LICENSE` file with the MIT license in the root folder\n- We will use a modified version of [`project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml`](project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml \":ignore\") with 10 realistic questions. Correct answers will be awarded up to 2 marks each.\n- Your score will be the sum of the marks above. No normalization. What you get is what you get.\n\nBonus:\n\n- 1 mark if your GitHub repo includes a script that scrapes the Discourse posts across a date range from a Discourse course page like [TDS](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/c/courses/tds-kb/34)\n- 2 marks if we deploy your solution (with minimal modifications) as an official solution for students to use.\n"
