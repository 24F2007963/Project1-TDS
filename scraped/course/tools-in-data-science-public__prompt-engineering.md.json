  "text": "## Prompt Engineering\n\nPrompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts for large language models (LLMs).\n\nOne of the best ways to approach prompt engineering is to think of LLMs as a smart colleague (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions.\n\nThe most authoritative guides are from the LLM providers themselves:\n\n- [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/)\n- [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/introduction-prompt-design)\n- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)\n\nHere are some best practices:\n\n### Use prompt optimizers\n\nThey rewrite your prompt to improve it. Explore:\n\n- [Anthropic Prompt Optimizer](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-improver)\n- [OpenAI Prompt Generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-generation)\n- [Google AI-powered prompt writing tools](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/ai-powered-prompt-writing)\n\n### Be clear, direct, and detailed\n\nBe explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture.\n\n- **BAD**: _Explain gravitation lensing._ (Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.)\n- **GOOD**: _Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it\u2019s observed and its significance in astronomy._ (Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.)\n\n> When you ask a question, don\u2019t be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs.\n> The clearer you are, the better the answer you\u2019ll get.\n> For example, don't just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing.\n> Say, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it\u2019s observed and its significance in astronomy.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/be-clear-and-direct)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-include-details-in-your-query-to-get-more-relevant-answers)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/clear-instructions)\n\n### Give examples\n\nProvide 2-3 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style.\n\n- **BAD**: _Explain how to tie a bow tie._ (Reason: No examples or reference points given.)\n- **GOOD**:\n  _Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example:_\n\n  1. _To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight..._\n  2. _To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through..._\n\n  _Now, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie._ (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.)\n\n> Give examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don\u2019t just say \u2018build something.\u2019\n> Giving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/multishot-prompting)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-provide-examples)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/few-shot-examples)\n\n### Think step by step\n\nInstruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, well-structured answers.\n\n- **BAD**: _Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied?_ (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.)\n- **GOOD**: _Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step._ (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.)\n\n> Ask the model to think step by step. Don\u2019t ask the model to just give the final answer right away.\n> That's like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head.\n> Instead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves \u2014 like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb.\n> For example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-of-thought)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#strategy-give-models-time-to-think)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/break-down-prompts)\n\n### Assign a role\n\nSpecify a role or persona for the model. This provides context and helps tailor the response style.\n\n- **BAD**: _Explain how to fix a software bug._ (Reason: No role or perspective given.)\n- **GOOD**: _You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process._ (Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.)\n\n> Tell the model who they are. Maybe they\u2019re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication.\n> By clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style.\n> Suddenly, your explanation sounds like it\u2019s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/system-prompts)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-ask-the-model-to-adopt-a-persona)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/assign-role)\n\n### Use XML to structure your prompt\n\nUse XML tags to separate different parts of the prompt clearly. This helps the model understand structure and requirements.\n\n- **BAD**: _Here\u2019s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example._ (Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.)\n- **GOOD**:\n  ```xml\n  <instructions>\n    Provide a summary of the concept of machine learning.\n  </instructions>\n  <example>\n    Then provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter).\n  </example>\n  ```\n  (Reason: Uses XML tags to clearly distinguish instructions from examples.)\n\n> Think of your request like a box. XML tags are neat little labels on that box.\n> They help keep parts sorted, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-use-delimiters-to-clearly-indicate-distinct-parts-of-the-input)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts)\n\n### Use Markdown to format your output\n\nEncourage the model to use Markdown for headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting features to produce structured, easily readable answers.\n\n- **BAD**: _Give me the steps in plain text._ (Reason: No specific formatting instructions, less readable.)\n- **GOOD**: _Provide the steps in a markdown-formatted list with ### headings for each section and numbered bullet points._ (Reason: Directly instructs to use Markdown formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\n- **BAD**: _Correct the spelling and show the corrections._ (Reason: No specific formatting instructions)\n- **GOOD**: _Correct the spelling, showing &lt;ins&gt;additions&lt;/ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt;deletions&lt;/del&gt;._ (Reason: Directly instructs to use HTML formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\n\n> Markdown is a simple formatting language that all models understand.\n> You can have them add neat headings, sections, bold highlights, and bullet points.\n> These make complex documents more scannable and easy on the eyes.\n\n### Use JSON for machine-readable output\n\nWhen you need structured data, ask for a JSON-formatted response. This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized.\n\n- **BAD**: _Just list the items._ (Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.)\n- **GOOD**:\n\n  ````markdown\n  Organize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    { \"name\": \"Item 1\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 1\" },\n    { \"name\": \"Item 2\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 2\" },\n    { \"name\": \"Item 3\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 3\" }\n  ]\n  ```\n  ````\n\n  (Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output.)\n\nNote: Always use [JSON schema](playground#attachments) if possible. [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) is a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema.\n\n> Imagine you\u2019re organizing data for a big project. Plain text is like dumping everything into one messy pile \u2014 it\u2019s hard to find what you need later.\n> JSON, on the other hand, is like packing your data into neat, labeled boxes within boxes.\n> Everything has its place: fields like \u2018name,\u2019 \u2018description,\u2019 and \u2018value\u2019 make the data easy to read, especially for machines.\n> For example, instead of just listing items, you can structure them as a JSON array, with each item as an object.\n> That way, when you hand it to a program, it\u2019s all clear and ready to use.\n\n### Prefer Yes/No answers\n\nConvert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales.\n\n- **BAD**: _On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works?_ (Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.)\n- **GOOD**: _Is this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No._ (Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what\u2019s being asked.)\n\n> Don\u2019t ask \u2018On a scale of one to five...\u2019. Models are not good with numbers.\n> They don't know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. \u2018Yes or no?\u2019 is simple. It\u2019s clear. It\u2019s quick.\n> So, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no.\n\n### Ask for reason first, then the answer\n\nInstruct the model to provide its reasoning steps _before_ stating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results.\n\n- **BAD**: _What is the best route to take?_ (Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.)\n- **GOOD**: _First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you\u2019ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route._ (Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.)\n\n> BEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking. Reasoning first, answer second.\n> That way, the model won't be tempted to justify an answer that they gave impulsively. It is also more likely to think deeper.\n\n### Use proper spelling and grammar\n\nA well-written, grammatically correct prompt clarifies expectations. Poorly structured prompts can confuse the model.\n\n- **BAD**: _xplin wht the weirless netork do? make shur to giv me a anser??_ (Reason: Poor spelling and unclear instructions.)\n- **GOOD**: _Explain what a wireless network does. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation._ (Reason: Proper spelling and clarity lead to a more coherent response.)\n\n> If your question sounds like gibberish, expect a messy answer. Speak cleanly.\n> When you do, the response will be much clearer.\n\n## Video Tutorials\n\nWatch [Prompt Engineering Tutorial \u2013 Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses (41 min)](https://youtu.be/_ZvnD73m40o).
